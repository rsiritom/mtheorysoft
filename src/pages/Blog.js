                <h3><bold>Interactive Voice Ads: Using Voice Dialogue Ads to Engage Your Audience</bold></h3>
                <br></br>
                <p>Interactive voice ads have launched audio advertising into a groundbreaking new era. </p>
                <p>A new wave of voice-enabled digital advertising has been slowly brewing underground since 2017. It wasn’t until the spring of 2019, however, that interactive voice ads evolved from a strategy companies simply talked about implementing down the road to something they’ve gone ahead and launched to better interact with their customers today.</p>

                <p>Some of the world’s biggest brands are now using interactive voice ads to engage with their consumers on an increasingly intimate scale. In fact, two of the most popular audio streaming services, Spotify and Pandora, introduced interactive voice ad integration to their platforms, suggesting to advertising industry experts that this is more than a fad or a flash in the pan.</p>

                <p>Gone are the days where companies talk at their target audiences. With the growth of voice-enabled tech, consumers now expect to have a personalized, voice-first dialogue with their favorite brands. </p>

                <p>As we move deeper into the voice-first era, it’s vital that your brand prepares for their first interactive voice ad campaign. We’re here to prepare you for that big step.</p>

                <p>That’s why we chatted with Brian Mullins, Client Happiness Manager at Instreamatic, the tech company that’s changing the audio ad industry with their interactive voice ads (which are also sometimes referred to as voice dialogue ads). Brian and the Instreamatic team have helped colossal brands, from automobile manufacturers Mazda, Ford, Nisssan, BMW, and Chevrolet, to restaurant chains McDonald’s, KFC, and Starbucks, to the likes of Adidas and HP, to launch revolutionary interactive voice ad campaigns.</p>
